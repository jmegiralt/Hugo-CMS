    Workshop Makes recognises the value and benefits that being creative can
    bring. It also knows that not everyone can afford to attend creative classes
    (usually those who would benefit most). With that in mind Workshop Makes
    Gives will give 10% of the profit from the classes run towards a bursary pot
    allowing those on lower incomes to join in.
